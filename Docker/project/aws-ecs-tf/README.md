## Setting Up our ECS Instance Using Terraform

I wanted to learn Terraform along with Docker/Kubernetes, and found
a tutorial on setting up and using Terraform to write and deploy 
infrastructure as code. 

- Prerequisites:
    - Setting up the AWS CLI: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjKhQoYeR4Q)
    - Installing Terraform: [Installation Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install)
    - Infrastructure as Code Tutorial: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgTPxw2oGI8)

### Cloud Provider Equivalents

Both Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform have equivalent solutions for managed Docker/Kubernetes deployments

- [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/kubernetes-service/)
- [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/)
